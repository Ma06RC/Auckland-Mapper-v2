# Auckland-Mapper-v2

  For this project, I only got up to completion as I have ran out of time to finish up to the challenge part. But I was able to implement 
  basic A* alorithm to my program that allows users to select a start node, then press the A* button after that the user is able to select
  his/her desired destination node and it automatically draw the shortest path. I was also able to implement the Articulation Point algorithm
  to my program to find critical intersection in the map. I implemented two design approach of my articulation point algorithm, recursive 
  and iterative approaches.
